      "\r\n",

      "earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\r\n",
      "bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\r\n",
      "sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\r\n",
      "moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\r\n",
      "was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\r\n",
      "sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\r\n",
      "away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\r\n",
      "say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\r\n",
      "it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\r\n",
      "corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\r\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\r\n",
      "hanging from the roof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\r\n",
      "and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\r\n",
      "other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\r\n",
      "wondering how she was ever to get out again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\r\n",
      "solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\r\n",
      "and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\r\n",
      "doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\r\n",
      "the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\r\n",
      "them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\r\n",
      "curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\r\n",
      "door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\r\n",
      "in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\r\n",
      "passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\r\n",
      "looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\r\n",
      "How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\r\n",
      "among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\r\n",
      "she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\r\n",
      "my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\r\n",
      "very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\r\n",
      "I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\r\n",
      "know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\r\n",
      "had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\r\n",
      "things indeed were really impossible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\r\n",
      "went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\r\n",
      "it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\r\n",
      "telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\r\n",
      "certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\r\n",
      "of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\r\n",
      "beautifully printed on it in large letters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\r\n",
      "Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\r\n",
      "first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\r\n",
      "for she had read several nice little histories about children who\r\n",
      "had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\r\n",
      "things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\r\n",
      "their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\r\n",
      "will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\r\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\r\n",
      "never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\r\n",
      "`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\r\n",
      "later.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\r\n",
      "to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\r\n",
      "of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\r\n",
      "turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\r\n",

      "idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\r\n",
      "case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\r\n",

      "conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find\r\n",
      "a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in\r\n",
      "the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\r\n",
      "behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\r\n",
      "she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\r\n",
      "feet high.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\r\n",

      "suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\r\n",
      "thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a\r\n",
      "little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\r\n",
      "first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\r\n",
      "she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that\r\n",
      "it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\r\n",

      "  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this\r\n",

      "think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\r\n",
      "trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\r\n",
      "this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\r\n",
      "(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:\r\n",

      "seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a\r\n",
      "mouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather\r\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\r\n",
      "eyes, but it said nothing.\r\n",

      "no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she\r\n",
      "began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\r\n",
      "her French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\r\n",
      "water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\r\n",
      "your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\r\n",
      "poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\r\n",

      "I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.\r\n",
      "She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\r\n",
      "as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\r\n",
      "nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\r\n",
      "she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital\r\n",
      "one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,\r\n",

      "certain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any\r\n",
      "more if you'd rather not.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end\r\n",
      "of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family\r\n",
      "always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\r\n",
      "the name again!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the\r\n",
      "subject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\r\n",
      "The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is\r\n",
      "such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!\r\n",
      "A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly\r\n",
      "brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and\r\n",
      "it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I\r\n",
      "can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\r\n",
      "know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\r\n",
      "He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\r\n",
      "sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the\r\n",
      "Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and\r\n",
      "making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\r\n",
      "again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\r\n",
      "like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam\r\n",
      "slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\r\n",
      "thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to\r\n",

      "I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a\r\n",
      "sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more\r\n",
      "HERE.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I\r\n",
      "am now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--\r\n",
      "but then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.  `How can you\r\n",
      "learn lessons in here?  Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no\r\n",
      "room at all for any lesson-books!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,\r\n",
      "and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few\r\n",
      "minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves\r\n",
      "this moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the\r\n",
      "stairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and\r\n",
      "she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she\r\n",
      "was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no\r\n",
      "reason to be afraid of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;\r\n",
      "but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed\r\n",
      "hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it\r\n",
      "say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she\r\n",
      "fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly\r\n",
      "spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not\r\n",
      "get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,\r\n",
      "and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was\r\n",
      "just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something\r\n",
      "of the sort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are\r\n",
      "you?'  And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then\r\n",
      "I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!\r\n",
      "Come and help me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.')\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why, it\r\n",
      "fills the whole window!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it\r\n",
      "away!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear\r\n",
      "whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer\r\n",
      "honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at\r\n",
      "last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in\r\n",
      "the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more\r\n",
      "sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there\r\n",
      "must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for\r\n",
      "pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I\r\n",
      "don't want to stay in here any longer!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at\r\n",
      "last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a\r\n",
      "good many voices all talking together:  she made out the words:\r\n",
      "`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;\r\n",
      "Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up\r\n",
      "at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half\r\n",
      "high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--\r\n",
      "Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind\r\n",
      "that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!  Heads below!' (a loud\r\n",
      "crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go\r\n",
      "down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,\r\n",
      "then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to\r\n",
      "go down the chimney!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said\r\n",
      "Alice to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!\r\n",
      "I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is\r\n",
      "narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and\r\n",
      "waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what\r\n",
      "sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close\r\n",
      "above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one\r\n",
      "sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes\r\n",
      "Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the\r\n",
      "hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold\r\n",
      "up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?\r\n",
      "What happened to you?  Tell us all about it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'\r\n",
      "thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm\r\n",
      "better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know\r\n",
      "is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes\r\n",
      "like a sky-rocket!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and\r\n",
      "Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.  I'll set\r\n",
      "Dinah at you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\r\n",
      "herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any\r\n",
      "sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they\r\n",
      "began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A\r\n",
      "barrowful will do, to begin with.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\r\n",
      "doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came\r\n",
      "rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.\r\n",
      "`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,\r\n",
      "`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\r\n",
      "silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\r\n",
      "turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\r\n",
      "idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she\r\n",
      "thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it\r\n",
      "can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I\r\n",
      "suppose.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find\r\n",
      "that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small\r\n",
      "enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\r\n",
      "found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\r\n",
      "The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by\r\n",
      "two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.\r\n",
      "They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she\r\n",
      "ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\r\n",
      "thick wood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\r\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\r\n",
      "and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.\r\n",
      "I think that will be the best plan.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\r\n",
      "simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the\r\n",
      "smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering\r\n",
      "about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over\r\n",
      "her head made her look up in a great hurry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round\r\n",
      "eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.\r\n",
      "`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried\r\n",
      "hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the\r\n",
      "time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\r\n",
      "would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of\r\n",
      "stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\r\n",
      "into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,\r\n",
      "and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice\r\n",
      "dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run\r\n",
      "over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy\r\n",
      "made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in\r\n",
      "its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very\r\n",
      "like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\r\n",
      "again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\r\n",
      "stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long\r\n",
      "way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat\r\n",
      "down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its\r\n",
      "mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\r\n",
      "so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out\r\n",
      "of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the\r\n",
      "distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she\r\n",
      "leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself\r\n",
      "with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks\r\n",
      "very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh\r\n",
      "dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let\r\n",
      "me see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or\r\n",
      "drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round\r\n",
      "her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see\r\n",
      "anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under\r\n",
      "the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,\r\n",
      "about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under\r\n",
      "it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her\r\n",
      "that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of\r\n",
      "the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large\r\n",
      "caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,\r\n",
      "quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice\r\n",
      "of her or of anything else.\r\n",

      "  `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very\r\n",
      "politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and\r\n",

      "very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'\r\n",

      "think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in\r\n",
      "a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth\r\n",
      "hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but\r\n",
      "at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent\r\n",
      "for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of\r\n",
      "adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and\r\n",

      "settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the\r\n",
      "trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled\r\n",
      "among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and\r\n",
      "untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the\r\n",
      "pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very\r\n",
      "carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and\r\n",
      "growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,\r\n",

      "few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,\r\n",
      "there's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes\r\n",
      "are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to\r\n",

      "thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be\r\n",
      "done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an\r\n",
      "open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\r\n",
      "`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come\r\n",
      "upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and\r\n",
      "that for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the\r\n",

      "on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For\r\n",
      "instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\r\n",
      "you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time\r\n",
      "he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But\r\n",
      "perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so\r\n",
      "VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might\r\n",
      "answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate\r\n",
      "came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just\r\n",

      "behind him.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the\r\n",
      "Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was\r\n",
      "sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The\r\n",
      "only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,\r\n",
      "and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from\r\n",
      "ear to ear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for\r\n",

      "speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.  Pig!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice\r\n",
      "quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought\r\n",
      "it would be as well to introduce some other subject of\r\n",
      "conversation.  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took\r\n",
      "the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work\r\n",
      "throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\r\n",
      "--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,\r\n",
      "plates, and dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when\r\n",
      "they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it\r\n",
      "was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up\r\n",
      "and down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS\r\n",
      "nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very\r\n",
      "nearly carried it off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a\r\n",
      "hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it\r\n",
      "does.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very\r\n",
      "glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her\r\n",
      "knowledge.  `Just think of what work it would make with the day\r\n",
      "and night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn\r\n",
      "round on its axis--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant\r\n",
      "to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and\r\n",
      "seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four\r\n",
      "hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?  I--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide\r\n",

      "many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always\r\n",
      "tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "ventured to ask.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at\r\n",
      "the proposal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,\r\n",
      "Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he\r\n",

      "interest in questions of eating and drinking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a\r\n",
      "minute or two.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently\r\n",

      "  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways\r\n",
      "of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went\r\n",
      "on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very\r\n",
      "earnestly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "I can't take more.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very\r\n",
      "easy to take MORE than nothing.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "triumphantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped\r\n",
      "herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the\r\n",
      "Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the\r\n",
      "bottom of a well?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and\r\n",
      "then said, `It was a treacle-well.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but\r\n",
      "the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse\r\n",
      "sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the\r\n",
      "story for yourself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt\r\n",
      "again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he\r\n",
      "consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they\r\n",
      "were learning to draw, you know--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this\r\n",
      "time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "one place on.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the\r\n",
      "March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather\r\n",
      "unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the\r\n",
      "only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a\r\n",
      "good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset\r\n",
      "the milk-jug into his plate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began\r\n",
      "very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw\r\n",
      "the treacle from?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so\r\n",
      "I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,\r\n",
      "stupid?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not\r\n",
      "choosing to notice this last remark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse\r\n",
      "go on for some time without interrupting it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and\r\n",
      "rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew\r\n",
      "all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Why with an M?' said Alice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  Alice was silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going\r\n",
      "off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up\r\n",
      "again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an\r\n",
      "M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--\r\n",
      "you know you say things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever\r\n",
      "see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got\r\n",
      "up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep\r\n",
      "instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her\r\n",
      "going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that\r\n",
      "they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were\r\n",
      "trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she\r\n",

      "little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,'\r\n",
      "she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,\r\n",
      "and unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went\r\n",
      "to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it\r\n",
      "in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down\r\n",

      "feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were\r\n",
      "ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\r\n",
      "soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were\r\n",
      "ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand\r\n",
      "in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next\r\n",
      "came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\r\n",
      "recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\r\n",
      "manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\r\n",
      "noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\r\n",
      "King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\r\n",

      "  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped\r\n",
      "and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'\r\n",

      "gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered\r\n",

      "  `Yes!' shouted Alice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "procession, wondering very much what would happen next.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.\r\n",
      "She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously\r\n",
      "into her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He\r\n",
      "looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised\r\n",
      "himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and\r\n",
      "whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `What for?' said Alice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.\r\n",

      "  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a\r\n",
      "little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a\r\n",
      "frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came\r\n",
      "rather late, and the Queen said--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,\r\n",
      "and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up\r\n",
      "against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or\r\n",
      "two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a\r\n",
      "curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and\r\n",
      "furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live\r\n",
      "flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to\r\n",
      "stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her\r\n",
      "flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,\r\n",
      "comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,\r\n",
      "but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened\r\n",
      "out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it\r\n",
      "WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a\r\n",
      "puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:\r\n",
      "and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,\r\n",
      "it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\r\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,\r\n",
      "there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\r\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers\r\n",
      "were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\r\n",
      "ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very\r\n",
      "difficult game indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  The players all played at once without waiting for turns,\r\n",
      "quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in\r\n",
      "a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went\r\n",
      "stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with\r\n",

      "least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,\r\n",
      "and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the\r\n",
      "game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The\r\n",

      "screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three\r\n",

      "taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and\r\n",
      "see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,\r\n",
      "leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like\r\n",
      "the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would\r\n",
      "be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage\r\n",
      "Queen:  so she waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "never!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the\r\n",
      "distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,\r\n",
      "as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart\r\n",
      "would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she\r\n",
      "asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the\r\n",

      "no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with\r\n",
      "large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to\r\n",
      "know your history, she do.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow\r\n",
      "tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've\r\n",
      "finished.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice\r\n",
      "thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he\r\n",
      "doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "a real Turtle.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only\r\n",
      "by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and\r\n",
      "the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very\r\n",
      "nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying\r\n",
      "down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half\r\n",
      "of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on\r\n",
      "the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently\r\n",

      "Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and\r\n",
      "when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her\r\n",

      "little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began\r\n",
      "dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the\r\n",
      "tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes\r\n",
      "were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her\r\n",
      "voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back\r\n",
      "the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and\r\n",
      "still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place\r\n",
      "around her became alive the strange creatures of her little\r\n",
      "sister's dream.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried\r\n",
      "by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the\r\n",
      "neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as\r\n",
      "the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,\r\n",
      "and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate\r\n",
      "guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the\r\n",
      "Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once\r\n",
      "more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's\r\n",
      "slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\r\n",
      "filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable\r\n",
      "Mock Turtle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\r\n",
      "Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and\r\n",
      "all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only\r\n",
      "rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the\r\n",
      "reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-\r\n",
      "bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd\r\n",
      "boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and\r\n",
      "all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the\r\n",
      "confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the\r\n",
      "cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\r\n",
      "heavy sobs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of\r\n",

      "she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and\r\n",
